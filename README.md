## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Sass
- Flexbox
- Component-based CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Screen-reader and keyboard accessibility testing

### What I learned

This was my first time using a mobile-first workflow. It was much easier to make adjustments to media-based CSS than when I used a desktop-first workflow. I also experimented with creating component-based CSS, to attempt to make the article component more reusable if it were repeated across a real website. This was also my first time integrating ARIA tags in addition to semantic HTML, and changing ARIA status with Javascript. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue improving my knowledge of Javascript to create the most logical, efficient solutions for my projects. I would also like to continue learning about accessibility and creating responsive websites. For this project in particular, I would have liked to add animations for when the share menu appears when it's clicked, and I believe the Javascript solution I chose might have given me some trouble with this.
